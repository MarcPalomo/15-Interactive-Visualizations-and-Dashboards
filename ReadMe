Thank you for coming to my Repo for the 15-Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards Homework.

You can find my Heroku site at: https://aqueous-chamber-67997.herokuapp.com/

The files in this Repo are:
Procfile
initdb.py
requirements.txt

The above 3 were essential in creating the Heroku site.

The "belly_button" folder contains folders that contain folders with code and more Heroku files:
__pycache__
__init__.py

The above 2 files wre also essential in creating the Heroku site.

The folder "db" contains the starter sqlite starter files.
The folder "static" contains another folder, "js", that contains my app.js code for the entire project.
The folder "templates" contains the "index.html" file that is disiplayed on the Heroku site (linked above).
